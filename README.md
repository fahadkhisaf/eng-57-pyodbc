### PYODBC and OOP

We are looking into the PYODBC package.
1)
And we are going to use the package to make a OOP module.
That abstracts our interaction with the NW DB.

2)
And then further abstract the interaction with specifiv tables.


Finally, where appropraite we will use the CRUD design to build methods.
